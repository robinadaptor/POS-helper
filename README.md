## POS-helper  
  
Recently, cryptocurrency of proof-of-stake are increasing. At the start, there are not many staking and node operators. The higher the scatter, the more likely the scamming rate will drop significantly. If blockchain becomes scam, please email us to our pos-helper. Note that pos-helper is very busy. So we need a little bitcoin donation (over $1). pos-helper must make normal blockchain by purchasing the cryptocurrency directly using donations. Please write your donation wallet address and problem in your google email and we will be happy to help. 
We will use Google Drive to provide services. Thank you.
